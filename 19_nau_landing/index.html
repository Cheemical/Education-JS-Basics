			<section class="textizakaya">Izakayas are often likened to taverns or pubs, but there are a number of differences.
			<br>
			<br>
		Depending on the izakaya, customers either sit on tatami mats and dine from low tables, as in the traditional Japanese style, or sit on chairs and drink/dine from tables. Many izakaya offer a choice of both as well as seating by the bar. Some izakaya restaurants are also tachi-nomi style, literally translated as "drinking while standing".</section>
